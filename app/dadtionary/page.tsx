        Common Chat Abbreviations
      </h2>
      <p className="my-6">
        Abbreviations commonly used in chats every HellDad should know:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-outside my-6 pl-6">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>AFK (Away From Keyboard):</strong> When you step away from the
          game for a moment—whether for bottle duty, bedtime, or to find that
          one missing shoe.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>BRB (Be Right Back):</strong> A quick heads-up that you’ll be
          away but not for long. Think of it as ducking out to handle a minor
          family emergency, like snack requests or toy disputes.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>CU / CYA (See You Around):</strong> A more casual farewell
          that suggests you'll catch up with your friends later, either in-game
          or in real life. It's like saying, “I’ll be back” without the
          commitment to a specific time—perfect for busy parents on the go!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>GG / GD (Good Game / Good Dive):</strong> A friendly way to
          say, "Well played!" or "Good job!" to everyone after a mission, win or
          lose. It’s like a pat on the back after a long day of parenting.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>GTG (Got To Go):</strong> When real life pulls you away for
          good (at least for now). Whether it’s time for work, school runs, or
          calling it a night, GTG lets your squad know you’re signing off.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>GN / GN8 (Good Night):</strong> A simple "good night" or
          "goodnight" shortcut. Perfect for HellDads calling it a day after a
          successful dive—or when it’s finally time to close the bedroom doors
          and collapse into bed.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>LOL (Laugh Out Loud):</strong> For moments when a mission goes
          hilariously wrong or the kids do something funny in the background.
          Often used as a good-natured “That was unexpected!”
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>o7 (Salute):</strong> This is a quick way to show respect or
          honor in the game—a little “o” for a head and a “7” for a saluting
          arm. Use it to acknowledge a heroic effort or to show respect for a
          fellow Helldiver!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>TTFN (Ta-Ta For Now):</strong> A lighthearted way of saying
          goodbye temporarily. It’s like saying, "Catch you later," but with a
          bit more flair! Perfect for when duty (or parenting) calls and you
          need to step away for a bit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12">Common Game Terms</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-outside my-6 pl-6">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Aggro:</strong> When you accidentally (or intentionally) annoy
          the enemy so much that they come straight for you. It's like when you
          accidentally wake a sleeping baby—expect chaos.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Buff:</strong> A boost to a player’s abilities, like a
          superhero power-up. Think of it as when you've had your coffee and can
          suddenly keep up with the kids all morning.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Camp:</strong> To stay in one spot, waiting for something to
          happen—like waiting for your toddler to finally fall asleep. In-game,
          it’s often waiting to ambush someone.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Damage Per Second (DPS):</strong> The measure of how much
          damage you can dish out. Imagine how quickly you can get things done
          once everyone’s finally asleep—that’s high DPS.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Drop In / Drop Out:</strong> Joining or leaving a game as
          needed. Ideal for HellDads who might have to duck out to handle family
          duties, then jump back into the action.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Experience Points (XP):</strong> Points that help you level
          up. Think of it as parenting wisdom.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Grind:</strong> Repeating an activity over and over to achieve
          something, like the endless cycle of explaining the meaning of “no” to
          your kids.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>4311 (Hell):</strong> Type it into a calculator and flip it
          upside down—suddenly, you’ve got “Hell”! Often used to joke about the
          tough challenges or chaotic missions that Helldivers are sent into.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Hit Points / Health Points (HP):</strong> This is how much
          “life” you or your character has, the same as how many things you can
          do per day before being exhausted.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Heads-Up Display (HUD):</strong> All the info on-screen during
          a game; it’s like wearing your glasses, but with augmented reality.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Lag:</strong> That frustrating delay between action and
          response, like asking a kid to do something, then waiting… and
          waiting… and waiting.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>1337 (Leet):</strong> This is gamer speak for “elite,” with
          numbers replacing certain letters. It’s shorthand for anyone who’s
          mastered their game (or feels like they have). Even if you’re holding
          a baby in one arm, you're still 1337 in our book!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Loot:</strong> Treasures or rewards you pick up along the way,
          like snacks in the pantry or lost socks around the house, also
          commonly known as Samples, Super Credits and Medals.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Loot Ninja:</strong> Squad member (you know who you are!) who
          grabs all the goodies on the battlefield—ammo, gear, upgrades—without
          considering sharing with the team. Good thing is, that collectibles
          are evenly shared with the whole squad anyway, such as Super Credits,
          Requisition Slits, Medals, Samples.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Meta:</strong> The “Most Effective Tactic Available.” It’s
          like finding the one trick that gets your toddler to eat their
          veggies—use it until they catch on!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Nerf:</strong> When an ability or weapon is made weaker, often
          to balance the game. It’s like saying, “No more chocolate before bed!”
          to reduce hyperactivity.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Non-Player Character (NPC):</strong> These are
          computer-controlled characters in the game on your Super Destroyer or
          civilians in the evacuation missions. Think of them like toys left on
          the floor—they’re just “there” in your environment and you don’t want
          to damage them.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Noob / Newbie:</strong> A new or inexperienced player.
          Sometimes you, sometimes your kids. Remember, every HellDad was a noob
          once!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Overpowered (OP):</strong> When a character or item is
          ridiculously strong, like when you’re the only one who knows how to
          get the kids to sleep.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Player vs Environment / Player vs Player (PvE / PvP):</strong>{" "}
          PvE is going up against in-game challenges; PvP is when you face off
          against other players. All Helldivers hopefully play PvE like HellDads
          do and don’t team kill each other!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Respawn / Reinforcement:</strong> Coming back to life after
          being defeated. It’s like your coffee finally kicking in after the
          morning chaos. Another dive, another life!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Tank:</strong> The player who absorbs all the damage and takes
          the hits for the team. You know, like a parent never giving up and
          staying strong for the family.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Team Kill (TK):</strong> This refers to a player accidentally
          (or sometimes deliberately) taking out a teammate in-game. It's
          usually frowned upon, especially in cooperative gameplay like
          Helldivers, where teamwork is essential. Let's focus on taking out the
          enemy instead!
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR):</strong> Sometimes you just
          need the summary, which this Dadtionary is perfect for!
