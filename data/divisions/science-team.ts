    "Research and Destruction",
  tactics: [
    `The Science Team favors advanced technology and often looks for new and unorthadox ways to use their gear and stratagems. While they tend to use Plasma, Heat and Arc based weaponry, due to the nature of their work, it is not uncommon to see them field-testing other loadouts. The FAF-14 & StA-X3's Lock on targetting systems and the RS-422's advanced firing mechanism makes them favorites amongst the Science Team's weapons researchers. Battlefield Engineers will often be accompanied by Guard Dog Drones and employ Sentry Turret, Mine Field and Combat Emplacement stratagems. Due to the high risk of friendly and/or self injury, as a result of battlefield experiments, it is common for one Science Team member to be equipped with a Stim Pistol.`,

  formation: [
    `The Science Team was loosly established in early February of 2185 when Commander Shilong, a former lead researcher for the Ministry of Science, requested the construction of a HellDads R&D Lab aboard the Democracy Space Station. Upon construction, the HellDads R&D Lab was granted funding by the Ministry of Science and given unlimited scope to conduct field research. It is rumored that the Science Team's first experiment resulted in the construction of the first B-100 Portable Hellbomb, which was immediately mass produced by the Ministry of Defense and entered into active service. Super Earth High Command believes the Science Team's experiments are vital to the ongoing war effort and is monitoring their research closely.`,
