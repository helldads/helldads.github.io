  description: [
    `Sneaky Sabateur. You don't exist, You never existed. The enemy will never even know you were there. You sneak in, plant bombs, and sneak out leaving rubble in your wake. This build is very fun and can easily go no kills on missions if desired. Smoke Grenade, Eagle Smoke, and Orbital Smoke give you plenty of cover to creep around, or can be used to break line of site with the bots and eventually make them lose interest. Holding grenade to have it pop on you is a great tactic for quick smoke on your location before you are discovered. The crossbow only attracts enemies to the location of the explosion (not from where you fire), so popping fabricators from a distance (and from smoke) can usually be done undetected. It is also a way to "lure" patrols away from you as they will go investigate the explosion. The Jump Pack will help you travel quickly, and if spotted, some smoke and a hop away and you are home free. The senator is what you will use to dispatch the few enemies should you need too. It is one of the quieter weapons in the game, and if you manage to get a 1 hit KO, other enemies at an obj or POI shouldnt notice the kill unless looking directly at it. The shield generator makes a great decoy for certain missions where you have to hold a point (flag or survey). Throw it somewhere off to the side and keep smoke on your objective and the bots will ignore you and go for they generator.`

  weakness: `This build is not really meant for a fight. If you get stuck having to fight you will struggle. It also has no AT, while you can kill Hulks with the senator you will not be killing Factory Striders, Tanks, or Towers. Turrets also don't really care that you are sneaking. Trying to take a Fortress can be difficult as the turrets and Anti Personel turrets seem to just see you regardless. You will need smoke and certain angles / entrances to make it work.`,
