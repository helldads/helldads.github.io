  slogan: "Big gun goes brrr!",
  description: [
    `You are the teams Heavy Gunner. You have a big gun that goes brrr. With Peak Physique you can swing this thing like a primary. The trick is to dive (or go prone) before unloading if you can. Hit the deck and unload the clip. The HMG can kill everything. And to keep that hungry machine fed, you will feed it with the supply pack. Stun Grenades pair wonderfully with this allowing you to stun any stubborn or quick enemies, or to allow you time to reload. The secondary is flexible, but the trusty Talon has not failed me yet, so I bring it with this build. Staying with the Heavy theme, we run the Eruptor as our Primary for closing Fabs / Holes, or for some heavy explosives when needed. To assist with our hose of large caliber rounds, we bring the Orbital Gatling Barrage. With a short CD you can throw this for every engagement. Throw it at the enemy and assist your ships fire with your own. And for the coup de gr√¢ce, when there are too many enemies for your limited magazine, plop down the HMG Emplacement for 300 rounds of Freedom. No reload. No Recoil. All Democracy.`,
  ],
  weakness: `This build is ammo hungry, and even with peak physique the recoil takes a bit of practice to control. Lay down (or crouch) and fire in bursts (1,2,3 - 1,2,3 - 1,2,3). Other then that you should handle everything just fine, lots of stim, lots of stuns, lots of bullets. You may struggle with heavies until you get comfortable hitting their weakspots, but once you do you will be unstoppable. When in doubt, drop the HMG Emplacement.`,
